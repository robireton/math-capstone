# MATH 5002 Â· Capstone Project in Mathematics

Capstone Project is designed to allow students in their final undergraduate year to explore a specific topic in the mathematical sciences through an independent, student-designed project under the mentorship of a faculty instructor. Students will be expected to develop their own project proposal with direction from their faculty mentor. The topic should be chosen to allow integration of material learned in core curriculum courses applied to a mathematical topic not generally taught in other undergraduate courses, or at a depth greater than achieved in such courses. Students will be expected to produce a substantial independent thesis, expository paper, applied mathematics or statistics project, or portfolio of relevant mathematical work. Students will be encouraged to present their project in a public forum. By Permission Only
