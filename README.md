# Rob Ireton’s Capstone Project in Mathematics

This is a portfolio of solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems implemented as [Julia](https://julialang.org) language [Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). My hope is that these can serve as examples for using the Julia language for learning mathematics and programming, and also as an example for configuring and using the technologies involved. There is also a little LaTeX scattered around in the notebooks.


## How to View or Run


### View on [GitHub](https://github.com/robireton/math-capstone)

The canonical home for this project is this GitHub repository. It is possible to see the notebooks here, but the display is much less robust. Use this version to get your own copy of the code and to get some insight into how it was created by browsing the history.


### View on [nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/robireton/math-capstone/tree/master/)

This is the easiest option if you just want to view the notebooks. The display will be much better than on GitHub.


### Run on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/robireton/math-capstone/master)
Use this option if you want to modify the code without installing anything on your computer.

### Install Locally
These are the expert options. Start by cloning the repository.

`git clone https://github.com/robireton/math-capstone.git`

If you already have a way to view/run `.ipynb` notebook files and have [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) installed, you should be good-to-go. 
Otherwise, you can run the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) server in a Docker container by [installing Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and then running:

`docker-compose up`

in the cloned folder. You can create a `.env` file if you want to set a password or run at a particular path.
