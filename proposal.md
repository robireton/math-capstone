# Capstone Project Proposal
	
For my Undergraduate Capstone Project in Mathematics, I propose to create a portfolio of Jupyter Notebooks where I solve and present problems from Project Euler using the Julia programming language. I have been aware of and interested in the Julia language for a few years now but have never had an opportunity to learn it well. Jupyter Notebooks will allow me to present code and results interspersed with discussion text that can include LaTeX-typeset mathematical material. This will allow me to not just solve problems, but also to connect them to theory learned through the course of my undergraduate work. The portfolio will be made available as a GitHub repository in the hope that it will be useful to mathematical educators as an example of a method for presenting this type of material.

## Example
An example of what I am proposing to include in my portfolio may be viewed at:

## About Project Euler
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. https://projecteuler.net/

## About Jupyter Notebooks
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer. Your code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types. https://jupyter.org/

## About Julia
The Julia programming language is appropriate for scientific and numerical computing, with performance comparable to traditional statically-typed languages. Julia is multi-paradigm, combining features of imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming. Julia provides ease and expressiveness for high-level numerical computing, in the same way as languages such as R, MATLAB, and Python, but also supports general programming. To achieve this, Julia builds upon the lineage of mathematical programming languages, but also borrows much from popular dynamic languages, including Lisp, Perl, Python, Lua, and Ruby. https://julialang.org/
