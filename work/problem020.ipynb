    "Compare that to the 16 or maybe 32 bits available for integers in the machines I started programming on, or even the 64 or maybe 128 bits available now. One of the things that makes this computation possible is the inclusion of [The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/) in many modern programming languages, including Julia. That’s the source of the `big` in the four-function composition that gives the answer. It’s also where the implementation of `factorial` comes from, although Julia does provide an integer implementation for small values. In the past I would have needed to write my own implementation, choosing a recursive or an interative algorithm and having to find some clever work-around to keep from overflowing machine integers.\n",

    "I would also have had to implement `digits` myself, probably by repeatedly finding the residual modulo $10$. Same for `sum`. That would have needed a loop and an accumulator variable. Instead, I get to compose four functions (using a mathy operator!) and, *Bob’s your uncle*. Alternatively, I could have used function chaining notation for a more Unix-like and less Math-like look:"
